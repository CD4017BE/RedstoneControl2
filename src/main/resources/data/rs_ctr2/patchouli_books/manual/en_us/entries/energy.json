Instead, whenever a device needs energy to perform an action, it will try to drain it from the energy storage device it is $(l:connecting)connected to$(/l) and fail the action if it can't be supplied instantly."

This means, you can't connect a machine directly to a generator, there always has to be storage in between!\\pSince storage devices are passive they can't be connected to each other directly either. Instead you can use a \\iTransformer\\d to continuously transfer power between them."
