These operators also count towards the \\c$(t:see stats tool-tip on Splitter item)Splitter chain limit$(/t)\\d, so you may need to manually insert ->"

Over-clocking machinery beyond what its circuitry supports will result in incorrect control signals that create a big mess. So if things stop working correctly you might be running them too fast.\\pOptimizing circuits to handle higher clock-rates can be a rewarding challenge for advanced players."
