   "text": "Just like Redstone Torches and Repeaters have propagation delays, most components have a signal latency of one tick (twice as fast as normal Redstone). This means that output values of an operation will be based on the input values from the previous tick. In item tool-tips this is indicated by a [t+1] on outputs or a [t-1] on inputs."

   "text": "There are some single input operators that have a zero tick latency, meaning their outputs react instantly to changed inputs. These operators also count towards the \\c$(t:see stats tool-tip on Splitter item)Splitter chain limit$(/t)\\d, so you may need to manually insert \\iDalay Lines\\d to propagate the sigal further in long chains of zero tick operators."
